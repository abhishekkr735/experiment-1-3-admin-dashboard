## 2. Title
Design and Development of a Responsive Admin Dashboard using HTML, CSS Grid, and JavaScript with Theme Switching.

## 3. My Defined Approach

In this experiment, I designed and developed a responsive admin dashboard using core web technologies.  
The structure of the dashboard was created using **HTML**, ensuring semantic and readable layout.  
For styling and layout management, **CSS Grid** was used to create a clean and responsive interface.  

To enhance user interaction, **JavaScript** was implemented for theme switching between light and dark modes.  
The project was developed using **Visual Studio Code** and version-controlled using **GitHub**.  

Finally, the project was deployed using **GitHub Pages**, making the dashboard accessible through a live URL.
